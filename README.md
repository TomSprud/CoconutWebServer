COCONUT WEB SERVER v0.1
=======================

This is a functional HTTP Web Server program written entirely in Java. It doesn't implement 100% of RFC 2616 spec but does a decent enough job of handling basic GET and PUT requests. It theoretically supports multiple request types as long as they are sent over a standard TCP socket. 

This software was written because I was bored one afternoon and wanted to play around with the java.net.* package.
